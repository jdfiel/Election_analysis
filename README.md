### Summary
The script used in this audit is simple to use as is simply reads the recorded votes from a CSV file and summarizes the data in a simple and comprehensive format. The script can easily be changed to accommodate a nation wide election, substituting the counties for states instead. The number of states/counties included in the election will not affect the performance of the script as all options will be automatically identified and listed by the script.  

The script could also be used to compare election results from different years simply by running the script one time for each election year and adding in the desired statistic calculations (ex. vote percentage).
